# Setup swift-doc

Let's get started by setting up `swift-doc` to build documentation for your project. 
There are two different ways how you can use swift-doc 
to create documentation for your project:
- If your project is hosted on GitHub, 
  you can use swift-docs' **GitHub action** 
  to build the documentation in a GitHub action workflow.
  
  [Please follow the guide for setting up the GitHub action then.](01-github-action.md)
  
- Run swift-doc as **command-line tool** on your local machine or in your build pipeline.

  [Please follow the guide for using the command-line then.](01-command-line-tool.md)
